# Personal Website Project

## Overview
This personal website project is a culmination of the skills and knowledge I acquired while learning at "Al Madrasa" platform. It serves as a personal portfolio to showcase my abilities in web development. This project is built using HTML, CSS, Flexbox, CSS Grid, and SASS, highlighting my proficiency in creating responsive and visually appealing web designs.

## Features
- **Responsive Design:** The website is fully responsive and provides an optimal viewing experience across a wide range of devices, from mobile phones to desktop computers.
- **Modern Layout:** Utilizes CSS Flexbox and Grid for layout management, ensuring a clean and structured appearance.
- **Styling with SASS:** Leveraged the power of SASS for efficient styling, enabling the use of variables, mixins, and nested rules for better organization and maintainability of CSS code.
- **Personal Portfolio:** Includes sections like About Me, Projects, Skills, and Contact Information, offering a comprehensive view of my personal and professional achievements.
